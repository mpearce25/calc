        <h2>Average Rates of Change and Secants Lines</h2>
            
    
        <h4>The <strong>average rate of change</strong> of a function over an interval is the amount of change divided by the length of the interval.</h4>  
    <h4>This “average rate of change” between point ‘a’ and ‘b’ is equivalent to the slope of the <strong>secant line</strong> which passes through points ‘a’ and ‘b’.</h4>  
    
    <h4>By combining this concept with limits it is possible to evaluate the <strong>instantaneous rate of change</strong> of a function at a given point.</h4>
    
    <h4>To find this make the two points on the secant line P and Q.Make point P the value of x at which you want to determine the instantaneous speed. Then make the second point an arbitrary point ‘Q’ and then find the limiting value of Q as it approaches ‘P’. <br></br>This gives you the instantaneous rate of change at point ‘P’. </h4>  
    <h4>This instantaneous rate of change is equivalent to the slope of the tangent line that passes through point ‘P’. </h4>
    
    <h4> In other words, the slope ‘m’ of the tangent line, at point P(a, f(a)) in function f(x), when x = a, is equal to <br></br><img src="images/deriv_limit.png" class = "centerimage" style="width:35%"> <br></br>as long as the limit exists at this point. </h4>
    
<h3>This can be demonstrated in the viewer below. By making the value of ‘H’ (the blue dot) closer to that of ‘A’ (red dot) the variable ‘m’ approaches the slope of the tangent line at x = a (this is the black line when h is infinitely close to A). </h3>

        <h1>Derivatives</h1>
        
        <h2>Definition</h2>
        <h4>The derivative of f, denoted as f’, at 'a' is the instantaneous rate of change (slope of tangent line), of a function 'f' when x = a. For this value to exist the limit must exist at the point ‘a’ and the function must be continuous at that point.</h4>
        <img src="images/deriv_def.png" class = "centerimage">
        <h4>This formula allows the derivative (slope of the tangent line) to be found at any continuous point ‘x’ to be found. </h4>
        <h2>Derivatives &amp; Limits</h2>
        <h3>Derivatives employ many of the same concepts as limits. </h3>
        <h4>A function is considered <strong>differentiable</strong> on a closed interval [a,b] if it has a derivative at every interior point. Additionally the limits at the endpoints must exist. To test if the limit exists at a right enpoint, 'b', take the righthand limit at that point.</h4>
        <img src="images/right_endpoint.png" class = "centerimage">
        <h4>To test if the limit exists at a left endpoint, 'a' take the lefthand limit at that point.</h4>
         <img src="images/left_endpoint.png" class = "centerimage">
        <h4>As derivatives are limits, for a derivative to exist at a point the limit must exist, which requires the right and left hand derivatives match at the given point.  </h4>
        <img src="images/equal_deriv_limit.png" class = "centerimage">
        <h4> As a result, if a derivative exists a point  x = a then the function is continuous at the point x = a. However the converse of this statement is not always true. For example the function |x| is continuous but not differentiable at x = 0.</h4>
        
        <h2>Derivatives Failing to Exist</h2>
        <h3>Corners</h3>
        <h4>In this case the one sided derivatives, or derivatives from the right and left hand side, will differ. These mainly can occur in absolute value functions and piecewise functions such as f(x) = |X| or in other cases such as sqrt (x<sup>2</sup>).</h4>
        <img src="images/corner.png" class = "centerimage" style="width: 55%;">
        
        <h3>Cusps</h3>
        <h4>The slopes of the secant lines approach infinity from one side and negative infinity from the other. Example 5(x)<sup>(2/3)</sup>.</h4>
        <img src="images/cusp.png" class = "centerimage" style="width: 55%;">
        
        <h3>Vertical Tangents</h3>
        <h4>The slopes of the secant lines approach negative or positive infinity from both sides. </h4>
        <img src="images/vertical_tangent.png" class = "centerimage" style="width: 55%;">
        
        <h3>A discontinuity</h3>
        <h4>One or both of the one sided derivatives will fail to exist. Example: floor(x) whenever x = an integer. </h4>
        <img src="images/floor.png" class = "centerimage" style="width: 55%;">
        
        
        
        <h2>Local Linearity</h2>
        <h4> If a function is differentiable at a point, the graph at that point will appear “locally linear”. A function has local linearity at a point, if when you zoom in on a graph the function appears to become a linear line.</h4>
        <h4>In a differentiable function like x<sup>2</sup> this occurs at every point. In non-differentiable functions such as |x|, the graph does not have local linearity at x = 0. </h4>
        <h4> You can see this in the graph below. As you zoom in towards the origin |x| never becomes locally linear but x<sup>2</sup> does.</h4>
        <div id="calculator2" style="padding-bottom: 20px;"></div>
        
        
        <h2>Intermediate Value Theorem for Derivatives</h2>
        <h4>If a function f(x) is differentiable on the interval [a,b], then f’ takes on every value between f’(a) and f’(b). This builds upon the more basic intermediate theorem which states: a function that is continuous on the interval [a,b] takes on every value between f(a) and f(b).</h4>

        <h2>Properties</h2>
         <h4>Derivatives, similar to limits have a series of properties and rules that can be used to break down the function and determine its derivative.</h4>
        
         <h3>Constant Functions</h3>
        <h4>The derivative, f’(x),  of a constant function such as f(x) = 5 is always zero.</h4>
         <h3>Power Rule</h3>
        <h4>If n is any rational number, either positive or negative, then the derivative of x<sup>n</sup> = nx<sup>n-1</sup></h4>
        
        <h3>Constant Multiple Rule</h3>
        <h4>The derivative of (c * u) = (c * u’). This means the derivative of any variable with a coefficent is simply the value of the coefficent.</h4>
         
         <h3>Sum and Difference rule</h3>
        <h4>If u and v are both differentiable functions of x, the and they are added or subtracted the derivative will be equivalent to the sum or difference of the individual derivatives. </h4>

        <h4>This means if two differentiable functions are multiplied the resulting derivative will be equivalent to the derivative of v multiplied by u, plus the derivative of u multiplied by v. </h4>

         <img src="images/quotient_rule_der.png" class = "centerimage" style="width: 45%;">

        <h4>As with the product rule it is useful to identify and find the values of u, u’, v, and v’.</h4>

        <h1>Implicit Differentiation</h1>
    <h2>Background</h2>
    <h4>The chain rule is critical when solving implicitly defined functions. 
</h4>
    <h4>Implicit differentiation allows the derivative (slope of tangent line) to be found in functions where the x and y variables are mixed together and the previous methods for finding derivatives do not work. </h4>
    <h4>The key is to treat the variable y as a differentiable function of x and then differentiate both sides of the equation <strong>with respect to x</strong>. This means 3y = 2xy is now really as 3y(x) = 2(x)(y(x)), and that y’ = (dy/dx). </h4>
    <h4>This is useful for various real life situations in addition to finding the instantaneous rate of change on shapes such as a circle whose formula is x<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>2</sup> = 25 .</h4>
    
    <h3> Implicit Differentiation Process</h3> 
    <h4>First: Differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to x.</h4>
    <h4>Second: Gather all the terms with (dy/dx)onto one side of the equation</h4>
    <h4>Third: Factor out (dy/dx)</h4>
    <h4>Fourth: Isolate / Solve For (dy/dx)</h4>
    
<h2>Applications</h2>
     <h4>Implicit differentiation is especially useful when finding equations of lines that are tangent to a point, specifically in curves and ellipses. </h4>

        <h1>Basic Applications of Derivatives</h1>
    <h2>Position, Velocity, and Acceleration</h2>
    <h4>Derivatives can be used in the real world to find the position, velocity, and acceleration of objects at any given time. Whenever taking the derivative in these situations it is key to take them with respect to time. Those variables are related in the following ways.</h4>
    <h3>(Instantaneous) Velocity</h3>
    <h4>(Instantaneous) Velocity is the derivative of the position function s = f(t)  with respect to t. </h4>
    <img src="images/velocity.png" class="centerimage">
    <h4>This is because velocity is the change in position over a certain time, resultingly when taking the derivative of the position function you get the instantaneous velocity (change in position) at time t. </h4>
        
        <h3>Speed</h3>
        <h4>Speed and velocity while closely related are not the same. Velocity is a vector, while speed is a magnitude. This means that Velocity has a direction (usually indicated by  a + or - sign for basic equations) while speed is only a value. Therefore speed since it is always positive is the absolute value of velocity. 
</h4>
        <img src="images/speed.png" class="centerimage">
    
    <h3>Acceleration</h3>
        <h4>Acceleration is the derivative of the velocity function v(t) and the second derivative of the position function with respect to t. 
</h4>
        <img src="images/acceleration.png" class="centerimage">
    <h4>This is because acceleration is instantaneous rate of change in velocity. </h4>
    
    <h3>Uses of higher order derivatives</h3>
    <h4>By taking higher order derivatives you can continue to find the instantaneous rates of change of objects. The derivative of acceleration yields the <strong>jerk</strong> of an object. Beyond that the derivatives are referred to as: snap, crackle, and pop.</h4>
