        <h3>Knowing my weaknesses</h3>
        <h4>I believe one of the main contributors to my success this year has been my ability to easily identify the areas and concepts in which I struggle. This allows me to study far more effectively for exams as I can focus on practicing the specific type of questions that I struggle with and not waste time on concepts that I fully understand. Additionally, when I still don’t understand a concept after doing a few practice problems I am able to find videos online that reinforce the concepts we learned in class. My most commonly used outside resources include videos from Khan Academy, mathbff, and patrickJMT.</h4>
            
            <h3>Preparation</h3>
        <h4>When we have an upcoming exam I feel that I prepare extremely well. While this may not always involve preparing for long periods of time, I always am confident going into exams that I will be able to successfully complete almost any question asked. I review the major topics we cover in class and do various practice problems from the grey & maroon prep book and occasionally the Barron’s review book. I will also revisit some homework problems if I remember that I did not understand them the first time. </h4>
            
            
            <h3>Participation</h3>
        <h4>By focusing intently on the lessons in class I am able to quickly grasp new concepts and successfully complete the majority of practice problems. I also always complete the practice problems we do in class and if I have extra time, I will attempt additional problems in our packets. </h4>
            
            
            <h3>Explaining Concepts</h3>
        <h4>If, when we are completing practice in class and a nearby peer does not understand a concept I attempt to explain the process of how to solve the problem. Not only does this often help others but it gives me a stronger understanding as it forces me to restate the information in new ways and not just memorize the lesson or what the book says. </h4>
            
            
            <h3>Time Management on Exams</h3>
        <h4>Throughout this entire year I have always been able to complete every question on exams. My strategy of quickly previewing the quiz before starting allows me to estimate the amount of time I should spend on particular questions. Additionally if I am stuck on a question instead of wasting valuable minutes I simply skip it and then come back once I have finished the other questions on the exam. Another benefit of doing this is that other questions on the exams often remind me of how to complete the problem I was previously unable to do. </h4>
            
        
        <h2>Calculus Skills</h2>
        <h4>Over the course of the year I feel as if I have developed a very strong understanding of almost every topic we covered. As mentioned above if I do not understand a topic I will make sure to focus on and practice that skill specifically until I understand it. </h4>
            <h4>Additionally this project has provided a very comprehensive review of all the material we covered this year. <br></br>Regarding concepts, I would say I am best at:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Quickly taking complex derivatives without having to write out the steps</li>
        <li>Understanding how the higher order derivatives connect to the original function</li>
        <li>Finding extrema</li>
        <li>Linearization &amp; Differential Problems</li>
        <li>Implicit Differentiation</li>

        <h3>Not Showing Work</h3>
        <h4>One of the main reasons I get problems wrong when practicing or on exams despite understanding the concepts is careless mistakes. Often this is a result of not showing my work or trying to skip steps by doing them in my head. For example on the derivatives quiz, after correctly writing out the quotient rule I did all the steps correctly but then forgot to divide the numerator by v^2. Additionally I have gotten questions wrong for forgetting to write negative signs or incorrectly writing my final answer. Furthermore, when practicing I rarely do all the steps out. As a result if I get the problem wrong it is hard to go back and determine where I made my mistake or what step I am missing. </h4>
        
        <h3>Consistently doing homework</h3>
        <h4>Often I feel confident enough in my understanding of materials that I do not complete homework assignments. However, I believe it may be beneficial to complete full or partial homework assignments more frequently so that I am exposed to different types of problems and therefore be better prepared for exams and better understand the material. </h4>
        
        <h3></h3>
        <h4></h4>
        <h2>Calculus Skills</h2>
        <h4>As mentioned under my strengths, I usually pinpoint the concepts that I struggle with and practice until I understand them; however, these are the topics that I feel I occasionally have trouble with</h4>
        
        <h3>Taking derivatives of trig functions</h3>
        <h4>This applies to both standard trig functions and inverse trig functions. Sometimes if I am doing a problem involving these I am unable to complete it, not because I don’t understand what it is asking or how to complete it but solely because I forgot the derivatives. I also find the inverse trig functions particularly confusing because many of them are so similar and only differ by a negative sign or square root in one location.</h4>

        <h1>Improvement Plan</h1>
        <h4>While I am overall very pleased with my performance in this course I do believe I can still improve. My biggest goal going into the second half of the year is to complete my homework on a more consistent basis. I believe this would increase my understanding of concepts and reduce the amount of time I have to study for exams. To accomplish this goal I plan to put the calculus homework assignments in the same calendar as my other classes instead of relying on google classroom which gets used in few of my classes. To avoid making careless mistakes I plan to skip fewer steps when completing problems as the time required to show all your work is not significantly higher than doing it mentally. Doing so would also mean that I would be more confident in my answers and have to spend less time double and triple checking my solutions. </h4>
